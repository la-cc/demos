# Guest Lecture: Platform Engineering Org 2025 ‚Äì How to Build a Multitenancy Internal Developer Platform (WIP)

> ***Heads up:*** Build it locally if you want:
> `docker build . -f tools/templater/build/docker/Dockerfile -t workshop-templater:0.0.0`


## üîß Tooling: Igor

To simplify templating workflows, we use [`igor`](https://github.com/la-cc/igor) ‚Äî a lightweight shell wrapper to run your Docker-based tooling with ease.

### Install Igor:

```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/la-cc/igor/main/igor.sh -o /usr/local/bin/igor
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/igor
```

## Workflow Overview

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-0.png)


---

## Architecture? Just a Quick Look

![workshop-1](zimages/workshop-1.png)

Yeah, that‚Äôs how things are wired.

---

## 1. Use Case: vCluster ‚Äì The Fast Lane to K8s

![workshop-2](zimages/workshop-2.png)

Dev team just needs a place to deploy stuff. No frills, no drama.
They want a Kubernetes playground. Here‚Äôs how little it takes:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "disabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: false
```

That‚Äôs it. Now spin it up:

```bash
igor ....
config-template --all
```

Need to jump into the cluster?

```bash
vcluster connect vcluster-project-x -n vcluster-project-x --server=vcluster-project-x.pe-org-lecture.stackit.run --print --kube-config-context-name vcluster-project-x > vcluster-project-x.yaml

kubectl --kubeconfig vcluster-project-x.yaml get ns
```

You're in. Done.

---

## 2. Use Case: vCluster + GitOps = üöÄ

![workshop-3](zimages/workshop-3.png)

Now the devs want GitOps.
Why? Because they‚Äôre tired of clicking and guessing.

Update the config:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "enabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: false
```

Use `k9s`, cruise around:

```bash
k9s --kubeconfig vcluster-project-x.yaml
```

Wanna go full SSO? Sure. But **don‚Äôt** leave the Argo admin account wide open.
Either:

* Disable admin
* Add limited users
* Or better: Dex + your OIDC provider

SSO the right way. No shortcuts.

---

## 3. Use Case: vCluster + GitOps + Own Turf (Isolated Nodepool)

![workshop-4](zimages/workshop-4.png)

Shared node pool too noisy? Performance sucks when everyone‚Äôs on the same boat?

Cool. Get your own node pool:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "enabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: true
```

Provision it:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Double-check:

```bash
kubectl get nodepool
```

Now check your app setup and `values.yaml`.
Push. Argo takes over. That's the GitOps promise.

---

## 4. Use Case: vCluster + Own Nodepool ‚Äì No GitOps

![workshop-6](zimages/workshop-6.png)

Second team joins. They want their own node pool, but no GitOps.

Still easy:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-y
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops-2"
    argocd: "disabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: true
```

Create the node pool:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Deploy. Test. All yours:

```bash
vcluster connect vcluster-project-y -n vcluster-project-y --server=vcluster-project-y.pe-org-lecture.stackit.run --print --kube-config-context-name vcluster-project-y > vcluster-project-y.yaml

kubectl --kubeconfig vcluster-project-y.yaml get ns
```

---

## Cleanup? Just Delete It

We like onboarding. But offboarding?
Nobody wants to clean up ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs this easy.

Remove the config:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "enabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: true
```

Then run Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Commit, push ‚Äî Argo wipes the slate clean.

## Want to Go Bigger?

![workshop-8](zimages/workshop-8.png)

* vSphere + Tanzu + LDAP
* Dex + OIDC + `kubelogin`
* Argo CD with Dex setup
* Automate it all: pipeline, pull requests, events ‚Äî your call

---

## Zoomed-Out View: The Big Picture

![workshop-7](zimages/workshop-7.png)

Everything sits on top:
Your cockpit, your sunrise, your vClusters, your other clusters.
Same model. Zero extra effort.

---

## What You‚Äôll Learn (or Already Did)

* How to build a real internal platform catalog
* What ‚Äúself-service‚Äù means (hint: not a pretty UI)
* GitOps: love it or hate it, it's powerful
* Developer pain is real ‚Äî make it go away
* App of Apps pattern, explained by doing
* ApplicationSets + cluster generators + label-based deploys
* Templating that actually scales
* Secrets management with External Secrets Operator = modern ops
* vCluster = ephemeral clusters in minutes
* Multi-tenancy done right
* Save serious \$\$\$ by doing this smart

---

## Demos:

You can see the demos from up in action below.

### 1: just a vCluster

Create a vCluster in a shared node pool, no GitOps, no frills.

![demo-1](zimages/demo-1.gif)

Connect to it, check namespaces.

![demo-1-1](zimages/demo-1-1.gif)

### 2: vCluster + GitOps

Create a vCluster with GitOps enabled, using Argo CD and ApplicationSets.

![demo-2](zimages/demo-2.gif)

### 3: vCluster + GitOps + Isolated Nodepool

Create a vCluster with GitOps and an isolated node pool.

Bootstrap the node pool with Terraform.

![demo-3](zimages/demo-3.gif)

Commit and push, so Argo CD can redeploy vCluster and Argo CD to the new node pool.

![demo-3-1](zimages/demo-3-1.gif)

Check the new node pool, see the vCluster running there.

![demo-3-2](zimages/demo-3-2.gif)

### 4: New Project Y: vCluster

Create a new project with a vCluster, GitOps disabled, and an isolated node pool disabled (diff from the demo description above).

![demo-4](zimages/demo-4.gif)

### 5: Cleanup Project Y

Cleanup the project Y by removing few lines.
